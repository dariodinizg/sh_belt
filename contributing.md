# Contributing Guide

We all look for ways to stop typing too much and the same thing over and over.
If you want a home for all thoses scripts you build to automate your processes,
welcome!


## HOW TO POST YOUR SCRIPTS
* Document your script with useful and clean instructions but, at least, two mandatory things:
* * __USES__: Short explanation to what it automates.
* * __REQUIRE:__ - Write here what the user needs to do for your script to work. Like "REQUIRE: Change the
  `app_name` with the name of your app".
* * __ARGUMENTS__ - Explain if its mandatory or optional, providing an example of sintaxe if possible.
* Remove the `.sh` extension of your file. We dont need to type that.
* Give the script a name that relates to its function. Silly say that, I know, but worthy to remember that you are sharing with others. Think about them!
* Put everything in a directory (look for existing ones in the repository) that relate to the context of your script like "Terminal", "Django", "Docker/Django", etc.


Thanks!
